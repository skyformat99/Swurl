# Swirl

A library to wrap CURL for the Nintendo Switch. The idea is to have a simple library that you can pass a request to and recieve callbacks on progress updates, completion and if there was an error. Right now the response object will parse out the response header, but will in the future parse out JSON bodies as well.


## Installation

```bash
make
sudo make install
```
